The first person to discover and observe Jupiter’s moons was Galileo (1564-1642).
"Closest to Jupiter is Io,  further away is Europa, and there are two large outer moons, Ganymede and Callisto."
Io is so close to the planet that the pull of Jupiter’s gravity is constantly disturbing Io’s surface with volcanic eruptions.

In 1782 George III appointed Herschel as Astronomer Royal.
Herschel also discovered 2 of Uranus’ moons with a larger telescope.
"Uranus has a total of 27 moons, most of whom are named after characters in Shakespeare’s Midsummer Night’s Dream."
"The five major moonsof Uranus are called  Titania, Oberon, Miranda, Ariel and Umbriel. "
"Most of the centre of Uranus is a frozen mass of ammonia and methane, which gives it the blue-green colour. "
Uranus orbits the Sun lying on its side and takes 84 years to complete one orbit.
"Uranus takes 17.9 hours to turn once on its own axis, faster than the Earth, which takes 24 hours and gives us the change from day to night."
Uranus was the ancient Greek God of the heavens whose sons were the Giants and Titans.
"Uranus is the smallest of the four “giants”, but is still several times larger than the Earth. "
"Uranus has a diameter of 29297 miles, or 47, 150 kilometres, compared to the Earth’s diameter of just under 8000 miles, or 12,760 kilometres"
"Uranus is 1782 million miles, or 2869 million kilometres from the Sun.  "
In 1977 Uranus passed in front of a star and astronomers observing the planet through giant telescopes saw nine rings around the planet.
"The planet which was exerting a gravitational pull on Uranus was Neptune, 10.9 AU further out into space."
The discovery of the planet Neptune was one of the most exciting discoveries in astronomy.
Neptune cannot be seen without a large telescope and was first seen in 1846 from the observatory in Berlin.
"The existence of Neptune had actually been “discovered” a year earlier, in 1845."
"Two astronomers, J.C.Adams in England and Urbain Le Verrier in France, had been puzzled by the shape of Uranus’ orbit."
"Neptune has a diameter of 29,297 miles, or 47,150 kilometres. "
"It takes Neptune 165 of our Earth years to orbit the Sun.  The Earth orbits the Sun in 365 days, one year."
In 2011 Neptune completed the first orbit of the Sun since its discovery 165 years before in 1846.
"Neptune spins slightly faster on its axis, taking just over 19 hours to turn right round."
"In the same year that Neptune was first seen, 1846, its first moon was also spotted and named Triton."
Triton is a most unusual moon since it orbits Neptune in the opposite direction of Neptune’s own rotation on its axis.
Triton is about the same size as our own moon. 
"A smaller moon, Nereid, was discovered by telescope in 1949 and six further moons were discovered in the 1980s by the Voyager spacecraft. "
Pluto was first seen by use of a telescope in 1930.

"Like all stars, the Sun is composed of a great burning ball of gases. It is made of 92.1% hydrogen and 7.8% helium."
The Sun has six layers.
The centre of the Sun is its core which produces all the Sun’s energy.
"It takes about 170,000 years for the Sun’s energy to move from the core through the radiative zone to the next layer, the connective zone."
"From the connective zone, great bubbles move into the Sun’s surface, the photosphere."
From the photosphere the Sun’s radiation escapes to the earth as sunlight.
It takes about 8 minutes for the sunlight to be seen on the earth after it has left the Sun.
"Outside the Sun’s surface, or photosphere, are two further layers of light gases, the chromosphere and the corona."

The side of the Earth that faces the Sun has daytime and the side of the Earth that is turned away from the Sun has night-time.  
As the Earth orbits round the Sun it tilts very slightly and so gives us the seasons. 
"The Earth is 93 million miles, or 150 million kilometres from the Sun."
"The Earth’s diameter, the distance round its middle at the Equator, is 7928 miles, or 12760 kilometres."

"Rockets are used to power the space shuttles, which orbit the earth and explore outer space, too."
"Rockets' fuel enables them to travel at 24,000 miles per hour!"
"Rockets work by burning fuel. As fuel burns and swells out behind, the swelling pushes the rocket forward."
"Solid-fuel rockets are the oldest of all engines, used by the Chinese a thousand years ago."
"Solid-fuel engines are basically rods of solid, rubbery fuel with a tube down the middle."
Most powerful launch rockets use liquid fuel. The Space Shuttle uses hydrogen. Other fuels include kerosene.

Satellites are launched into space by rockets or carried into space by the space shuttle.
One half of the Moon is always in darkness and the other half is illuminated by the Sun. 
"The Moon gives off no light of its own, but is the brightest object in our sky because it reflects the light of the Sun."
The Sun is a medium size star known as a yellow dwarf that exists within the Milky Way Galaxy.
Scientists believe that the Sun was formed from a cloud of gas and dust about 5 billion years ago. 
"In about 5 billion years when all of its hydrogen has been converted to helium, it will cool, change color and become a red dwarf star. "
The Sun's energy is created by the transformation of the hydrogen gas of the Sun's core into helium gas.

"The spacecraft communicates with Earth through the Deep Space Network's largest antennas, which are up to 70 meters (230 feet) in diameter."
"In some ways, the spacecraft has senses better than our own. It can ""see"" in wavelengths of light and energy that the human eye cannot."
Cassini-Huygens is an international collaboration between three space agencies. 
The Cassini spacecraft was built and managed by NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory. 
The Huygens probe was built by the European Space Agency. More than 250 scientists worldwide will study the data collected.
The Italian Space agency built the high-gain communication antenna.
Scientists believe that new stars form inside of nebulae. 
A nebula is a gigantic cloud of dust and gas; mainly of hydrogen and helium gases.
Astronomers believe that nebulae are made from the huge collapse of gas in what they refer to as the Interstellar Medium.
"Interstellar Medium (the gas, dust and cosmic rays that can be found between planets and stars in galaxies)."
Quasars are extremely distant objects in our known universe. They are the furthest objects away from our galaxy that can be seen.
Quasars are extremely bright masses of energy and light. 
The name quasar is actually short for quasi-stellar radio source or quasi-stellar object.
Quasars appear as faint red stars to us here on Earth.
A quasar gradually attracts this gas and sometimes other stars or or even small galaxies with their superstrong gravity.
A quasar is believed to be a supermassive black hole surrounded by an accretion disk. 
"When we look at quasars which are 10-15 billion light years away, we are looking 10-15 billion years into the past."
"Space Shuttle is an ingenious cross between an airplane, and a rocket."
The U.S. Space Shuttle Columbia completed its first mission in April 1981 and made several successive flights.
"The U.S. Space Shuttle Columbia was followed by the Challenger, which made its first mission in April 1983."
"Today only astronauts can visit Outer Space, This is because a space shuttle mission is very expensive."
NASA is developing new space crafts that will eventually replace the Space Shuttle such as the x34 and x33.
Warp speed has been the subject of science and science fiction for many years.
"In order to qualify as ""Warp Speed"", a craft must be able to travel at speeds faster than light speed."
"Space is also very very cold, so an astronaut's spacesuit keeps them warm, while protecting them from deadly radiation."
Astronauts often go on spacewalks to fix and build space stations.
Astronauts can get a sense of weightlessness before they travel into orbit.
"In 1609, a scientist by the name of Galileo Galilei first peered through his small homemade telescope at the stars. "
"In the 1680s, Isaac Newton invented the reflecting telescope."
Reflecting telescope had a mirror inside that would reflect the image to a focus point.
An interferometer has the same power as would a telescope the size of the distance between the telescopes being used.
"Hans Lippershey, a German-Dutch lensmaker was the first person to ever think of the telescope in 1608."
German priest and astronomer Christoph Scheiner builds a telescope based on a design that astronomer Johannes Kepler made in 1611.
"Inspired by the observations of Jupiter made by Galileo, Dutch astronomer Christian Huygens builds the most powerful telescope ever."
" Laurent Cassegrain, a catholic priest from France, develops a telescope that bears his name - the Cassegrain telescope."
English mathematician (and inventor of the octant) John Hadley present a much-improved Newtonian telescope design in 1721.
American astronomer Alvan Clark builds the world’s largest existing refracting telescope - the Yerkes Telescope in Wisconsin in 1897.
Astronomer Sir Bernard Lovell planned a 250ft radio telescope that could be pointed to anywhere in the sky in the 1950s. 
"NASA and ESA’s Hubble Space Telescope, the first telescope to be launched into space."
The Compton Gamma Ray Observatory becomes the first space telescope to look at objects that belch out high energy waves called gamma rays.
In 2009 the Herschel Space Observatory is launched.
Radio telescopes detect noise from radio wavelengths in space.
The Gran Telescopio Canarias is the largest telescope of our time.
"X-ray telescopes are used to study mainly the Sun, stars and supernovas. "
Gamma ray telescopes are best used at high altitudes like the x-ray telescopes.
The Hubble Space Telescope (HST) is a reflecting telescope and is currently the largest space telescope there is.
"The Hubble Space Telescope is 43 feet long (13.1 meters) and weighs 24,250 pounds (11,000kg)."
The Hubble Space Telescope reflector is 94.8 inches in diameter (240cm).
"When you look at the Andromeda galaxy (which is 2.3 million light years away), the light you are seeing took 2.3 million years to reach you"
"Light from the sun takes 8 minutes to reach you, thus you see the sun as it was 8 minutes ago. "
"If you could put Saturn in an enormous bathtub, it would float. The planet is less dense than water."
A teaspoon-full of Neutron star would weigh about 112 million tonnes.
"Even on the clearest night, the human eye can only see about 3,000 stars. There are an estimated 100,000,000,000 in our galaxy alone!"
"If the sun were the size of a dot on an ordinary-sized letter 'i', then the nearest star would be 10 miles away."
Half-a-billionth of the energy released by the sun reaches the Earth
"If you could travel at the speed of light (186,000 miles per second) it would take 100,000 years to cross our galaxy!"
"On the equator you are about 3% lighter than at the poles, due to the centrifugal* force of the Earth spinning."
The atmosphere on Earth is proportionately thinner than the skin on an apple.
"If a piece of the sun the size of a pinhead were to be placed on Earth, you could not safely stand within 90 miles of it!"
"Every year the sun evaporates 100,000 cubic miles of water from Earth (that weighs 400 trillion tonnes!)"
Saturn is not the only planet with rings- Neptune has it's own ring system.
The Crab Nebula was produced by a supernova explosion in 1054 A.D.
Shooting stars are usually just tiny dust particles falling through our atmosphere.
A meteoroid is a small rock or particle of debris in our solar system. They range in size from dust to around 10 metres in diameter.
A meteoroid that burns up as it passes through the Earth’s atmosphere is known as a meteor.
A meteoroid that survives falling through the Earth’s atmosphere and colliding with the Earth’s surface is known as a meteorite.
The fastest meteoroids travel through the solar system at a speed of around 42 kilometres per second (26 miles per second).
The Earth’s atmosphere experiences millions of meteors every day.
Meteors are easier to see during the lower light conditions of night.
When many meteors occur in a close time frame in the same part of the sky it is called a meteor shower.
Around 500 meteorites reach the Earth’s surface every year but of those only around 5 ever make it to scientists for study.
Meteorites that are observed as they fall through the Earth’s atmosphere & later recovered are called ‘falls’ all others are called ‘finds’.
To this date there have been around 1000 collected ‘falls’ and 40000 ‘finds’.
A meteoroid that survives falling through the Earth’s atmosphere and colliding with the Earth’s surface is known as a meteorite.
"Asteroids are small solar system bodies that orbit the Sun. Made of rock and metal, they can also contain organic compounds."
Asteroids are similar to comets but do not have a visible coma (fuzzy outline and tail) like comets do.
Asteroids are also known as planetoids or minor planets.
"Asteroids vary greatly in size, some feature diameters as small as ten metres while others stretch out over hundreds of kilometres. "
The first asteroid was discovered in 1801 by Italian astronomer Giuseppe Piazzi named Ceres.
"Ceres was given dwarf planet status in 2006, along with Pluto, Eris, Makemake and Haumea."
The asteroid belt lies roughly between the orbits of Mars and Jupiter in the Solar System.
"As of 2008, there are five recognized dwarf planets: Pluto, Ceres, Eris, Makemake & Haumea."
Eris was discovered in 2005 and was referred to as the tenth planet until it was reclassified in 2006. 
Eris is the largest of the dwarf planets
Makemake was discovered in 2005 and the third largest dwarf planet behind Eris and Pluto.
Haumea was discovered in 2004 and named a dwarf planet in 2008.
